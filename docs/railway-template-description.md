# Deploy and Host Bemby on Railway

Bemby is a self-hosted automation tool for managing daily Telegram bot check-ins and Emby video watch sessions. It includes a web admin portal supporting multiple accounts, a built-in task scheduler, real-time logs, AI-assisted button recognition, and Telegram notifications.

## About Hosting Bemby

Hosting Bemby involves running a persistent Node.js/Express server that maintains active Telegram MTProto connections and a background task scheduler. All data is stored in a SQLite database, so a persistent volume is required to survive restarts. A single container serves the backend API, the Vue 3 web portal, and the scheduler together. Railway provisions the container directly from the official Docker Hub image and exposes it on port 3000. You supply an admin username, password, and a JWT secret at deploy time — everything else is handled automatically.

## Common Use Cases

- Automate daily Telegram bot check-ins across multiple accounts on a randomised schedule
- Simulate Emby media server watch sessions to maintain active membership status
- Run multi-step custom Telegram bot workflows with AI-assisted captcha and button recognition

## Dependencies for Bemby Hosting

- A Telegram API ID and API Hash from [my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps) — required to add Telegram accounts for check-in tasks
- An Emby server URL and account credentials — required for Emby watch tasks

### Deployment Dependencies

- Docker Hub image: [liveinaus/bemby](https://hub.docker.com/r/liveinaus/bemby)
- Source code: [github.com/liveinaus/Bemby](https://github.com/liveinaus/Bemby)
- Telegram API credentials: [my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps)

### Implementation Details

Three environment variables must be set at deploy time:

```
ADMIN_USERNAME   # Web portal login username
ADMIN_PASSWORD   # Web portal login password
JWT_SECRET       # Random secret for session tokens — generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
```

A persistent volume must be mounted at `/app/data` to retain the SQLite database across restarts.
